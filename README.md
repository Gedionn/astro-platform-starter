# Python Learning Notes

## 1. What is Python?
Python is a programming language used for:
- AI
- Machine Learning
- Web development
- Automation

---

## 2. Variables

Variables store data.

Example:
```python
name = "Gedion"
age = 25
print(Then press **Commit changes** ✅

👉 Now your notes are saved online.

# ✅ Method 2 — Find Python Notes on GitHub (Ready-Made)

Inside GitHub app:

Tap **Explore 🔍** and search:orLook for repositories with:
⭐ many stars (10k+ = very good).

Open → read README → these are free textbooks.

---

# ✅ Method 3 — Save Notes From Projects (Smart Learning)

When reading a Python project:

1. See new code
2. Copy important idea
3. Paste into your notes repo

Example:

You see:
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)## Loops

A loop repeats code.

Example:
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)Now you are learning actively.

# ✅ What Your Notes Should Contain (Learning Order)

Create sections slowly:

1️⃣ Variables  
2️⃣ Data types  
3️⃣ Input & output  
4️⃣ If statements  
5️⃣ Loops  
6️⃣ Functions  
7️⃣ Lists  
8️⃣ Dictionaries  
9️⃣ File handling  
🔟 Basic projects

# ⭐ PRO TIP (Very Important)
Real programmers **write notes while coding**.

Why?

Because:
- Memory improves
- You understand faster
- GitHub becomes your learning portfolio

After 1–2 months your GitHub will look like a real developer’s.

## 🚀 Since you are studying AI/ML
Python notes will later become:

- NumPy notes
- Pandas notes
- Machine learning notes
- GenAI experiments

This is exactly how AI engineers learn.
